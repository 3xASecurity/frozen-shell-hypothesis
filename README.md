# **The Frozen Shell Hypothesis of Black Holes**

Welcome to the **Frozen Shell Hypothesis of Black Holes** GitHub paxe for exploration and discussions.

At this stage, this hypothesis is purely an **exploration of ideas**—a thought experiment taken to its logical conclusions. It should **not** be interpreted as a claim of truth, nor does it aim to challenge established scientific consensus.

## **A Radically Different Interpretation**

This hypothesis emerges from a **simple profound thought experiment** and offers a **radically different interpretation** of black holes.

Instead of a **singularity of infinite density**, the hypothesis proposes that **the internal structure of a black hole is entirely hollow**, with **all matter and information effectively dissolved into the event horizon itself**.

Because this perspective challenges conventional understanding, it is **likely to be incorrect**. Even if it isn’t, it will undoubtedly face significant skepticism. But that doesn’t deter me from trying to **articulate it clearly** and seeking help to understand **where and why it might be flawed**. If for no other reason, because it is fun to play with ideas.

## **The Thought Experiment**

The idea begins with a deceptively simple question:

**What if a black hole is just a supernova stuck in time?**

In this scenario:

- During the gravitational collapse of a star, **time dilation reaches a critical threshold** where time effectively **stops** for an outside observer.
- This creates a **0-Time-Barrier**—a boundary through which **nothing can pass**, neither **matter nor information**.
- As gravitational collapse continues, this **0-Time-Barrier expands outward**, eventually becoming what we recognize as the **event horizon**.

From this foundation arises another compelling question:

**What if all matter, both inside and outside, ultimately gravitates and dissolves into this event horizon instead of collapsing into a singularity?**

## **A Hollow Black Hole?**

This thought experiment leads to several fascinating insights:

- The **interior of the black hole would be hollow**.
- The **center would be a place of zero gravity**, though still subject to **extreme time dilation**.
- Time would still flow—albeit incredibly slowly—and matter would gradually **migrate outward** toward the expanding 0-Time-Barrier.

If this is true, it would elegantly explain why:

- The **mass of a black hole is proportional to the surface area (of the event horizon), not its volume**.
- Observations supporting **Holographic Theories** align with this surface-based mass-energy encoding.

These outcomes are consistent with what we observe in astrophysics and theoretical models like the **Holographic Principle**.

## **A Call for Collaboration**

I have summarized the most important thoughts in a concise paper: [**frozen-shell-hypothesis.md**](frozen-shell-hypothesis.md).

I’m sharing this here because I’m seeking **your insight, feedback, and constructive criticism**:

- **Has anyone explored this idea before?**
- **If so, why was it abandoned?**
- **Are there fundamental flaws in this reasoning?**

This hypothesis is an attempt to make sense of black holes without invoking a central singularity, while preserving **General Relativity**, **Quantum Mechanics**, and the **Holographic Principle**.

I am **deeply grateful** for any thoughts, insights, or guidance you can provide.

## **Abstract**

The **Frozen Shell Hypothesis** offers a reinterpretation of black hole structure and formation, proposing that all mass and information of a collapsing star become trapped on a dynamically growing boundary referred to as the **0-Time-Barrier**. This boundary represents a state of **infinite gravitational time dilation** from an external observer's perspective, forming an **impenetrable causal shield** between the interior and exterior environments. Unlike traditional models predicting a central singularity, this hypothesis suggests that the black hole is **hollow**, with all mass effectively distributed on an **infinitely thin membrane** that stabilizes as the **event horizon**. This membrane satisfies the **Holographic Principle**, encoding all quantum information on its surface. Inside the barrier, a **frozen supernova explosion** persists, pushing matter outward, while **gravitational attraction from the barrier** simultaneously draws matter toward it. This dual dynamic ensures that **all mass migrates to and resides on the event horizon**. The **Frozen Shell Hypothesis** provides a consistent explanation of black hole formation, structure, and evaporation, resolving longstanding paradoxes while maintaining compatibility with both **General Relativity** and **Quantum Mechanics**.
