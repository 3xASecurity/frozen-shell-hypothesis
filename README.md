# The Frozen Shell Hypothesis of Black Holes

This page presents the Frozen shell Hypotheis of Black holes.
This hypothesis at this stage is just an interesting exploration of ideas and should not be any claims of truth.

This hypotheis is the result of a simple thought experiment and results in a radically different interpretation of the Black Hole phenomena.
Instead of a singularity of infinite density,
this hypotheis concludes that the internal structure of a black hole is completely empty,
with all matter dissolved into the event horizon itself.

Because of its radical re-interpretation of what a black hole actually is, it is most likely a wrong,
and even if it isn't, it will most likely meet resistance.
But that doesn't stop me from trying to articulate it and seek help to understand why it is wrong.

The thought experiment started with the following thought:

- What if a black hole is just a supernova stuck in time?

The reason it became stuck in time is that somewhere in the process of collapsing,
the concentration of matter reached the time of maximum time dilation where time stops.
This creates a time barrier where nothing can cross.
No matter and no information.
Anything that tries gets stuck in time for infinity.
This 0-time-barrier then eventually grows and becomes the event horizon.

So,
then what if all matter both on the inside and on the outside eventually gravitates
and dissolves into the event horizon instead of a singularity? What then would it be like to be on the inside of a black hole?

It's a fascinating thought.
Most likely work, but fascinating still.
For one, the center would be a place of 0-gravity,
still severely affected by time-dilation, but most probably, time would be able to flow, and matter move.

If all matter in the inside actually is drawn outward towards the event horizon,
this would explain why the mass of a black hole is directoy propotional to the surface area of the black hole, and not to its volume.
And this would then explain the observations leading to the Holographic theories of black holes.

I have summarized the most important thoughts in a very short paper in [frozen-shell-hypothesis.md](frozen-shell-hypothesis.md)

I put it up here because I want your help to explain what's wrong with it.
Has anyone before me tested this idea, and why then was the idea abandoned?

Grateful for any ideas and help!


## **Abstract**
The **Frozen Shell Hypothesis** offers a reinterpretation of black hole structure and formation, proposing that all mass and information of a collapsing star become trapped on a dynamically growing boundary referred to as the **0-Time-Barrier**. This boundary represents a state of **infinite gravitational time dilation** from an external observer's perspective, forming an **impenetrable causal shield** between the interior and exterior environments. Unlike traditional models predicting a central singularity, this hypothesis suggests that the black hole is **hollow**, with all mass effectively distributed on an **infinitely thin membrane** that stabilizes as the **event horizon**. This membrane satisfies the **Holographic Principle**, encoding all quantum information on its surface. Inside the barrier, a **frozen supernova explosion** persists, pushing matter outward, while **gravitational attraction from the barrier** simultaneously draws matter toward it. This dual dynamic ensures that **all mass migrates to and resides on the event horizon**. The **Frozen Shell Hypothesis** provides a consistent explanation of black hole formation, structure, and evaporation, resolving longstanding paradoxes while maintaining compatibility with both **General Relativity** and **Quantum Mechanics**.
