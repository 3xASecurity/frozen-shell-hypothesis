# The Frozen Shell Hypothesis of Black Holes

I have no right to write this hypothesis, but I do it anyway out of pure fun and interest in Black Holes.

I'm not a physicist. I'm just a computer science guy specialized in security and encryption protocols. But I'm fascinated by black holes.

I find the general explanations of Black Holes irrational,
in particular the general story of what might happen when you fall through the event horizon.
At the same time we say that:

- From an outside observer the time it takes to even reach the event horizon is infinite due to time dilation.
- Black holes do not exist forever. They evaporate through Hawkins radiation and eventually dissolves completely.

The process to dissolve a super-massive black hole is enormous, but still shorter than the eternity it takes to pass the event horizon.

I have run some thought experiments, just based on what we know, or what Quantum Physics and General Relativity tells us about reality.
That has led me to this hypothesis that I can't falsify myself (Surprise!! ðŸ˜Š).
I have also tried to falsify it using AI, but that attempt has also failed.
Instead, I find AI agreeing with this beyond my comfort.
So I need outside help.

Yes.
I'm sure this is wrong in some way.
I simply can't imagine having cracked one of the physics biggest mysteries by s simple thought experiment.
So I'm not after the Nobel prize here.
I just help to understand what's wrong with this hypothesis.

If you know this area and can help me. Please do. I would appreciate any ideas in the "Issues" section of this repository.

Thank you!

## **Abstract**
The **Frozen Shell Hypothesis** offers a reinterpretation of black hole structure and formation, proposing that all mass and information of a collapsing star become trapped on a dynamically growing boundary referred to as the **0-Time-Barrier**. This boundary represents a state of **infinite gravitational time dilation** from an external observer's perspective, forming an **impenetrable causal shield** between the interior and exterior environments. Unlike traditional models predicting a central singularity, this hypothesis suggests that the black hole is **hollow**, with all mass effectively distributed on an **infinitely thin membrane** that stabilizes as the **event horizon**. This membrane satisfies the **Holographic Principle**, encoding all quantum information on its surface. Inside the barrier, a **frozen supernova explosion** persists, pushing matter outward, while **gravitational attraction from the barrier** simultaneously draws matter toward it. This dual dynamic ensures that **all mass migrates to and resides on the event horizon**. The **Frozen Shell Hypothesis** provides a consistent explanation of black hole formation, structure, and evaporation, resolving longstanding paradoxes while maintaining compatibility with both **General Relativity** and **Quantum Mechanics**.
